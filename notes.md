## Nice to Haves

- Theme randomizer: shuffle between available themes for deck playthroughs.
- Branching decks: choice slide type or deck-to-deck links with history stack.
- Image search picker: in-editor integration to search and drop images directly (unsplash/google + upload).
- Missing image quick search: open Google Images from empty image slots (runtime/editor helper).
- Screenshot pipeline polish: optional watcher that regenerates screenshot decks automatically.
